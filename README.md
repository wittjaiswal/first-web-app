# First Web App

## Description

First Web App is an application that uses US Vehicle Sales data to provide insights on the price distribution of vehicles in the US by condition and the effect of the mileage on a car's price. Using plotly express, I created interactive visualizations that can be enhanced to view more details within the graphs and segregate segments of the population.

 ## Questions and Comments for reviewer

 I wanted to thank you for your feedback. Learning about transformation to fill in missing values is an important tool since I often get stuck wondering what the right method to fill in missing values would be. Emphasis on the readme is also important since it explains what we're trying to accomplish with the app for our audience. I added the link to the app in the readme as well. 
Thank you for your support and guidance.
